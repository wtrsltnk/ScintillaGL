# TODO

* Upgrade to opengl 4.6 and up

* Create hamburger button in the top left corner which opens a left sidebar/menu like the bootstrap offcanvas
* Pressing the ALT key once without any other key will also open the left sidebar/menu
* All menu items you see in normal window apps like File->New, File->Open.. and Edit->Copy etc are in this sidebar/menu
