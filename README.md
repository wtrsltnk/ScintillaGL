Below the original README:

-------
Building
===================================

Code is windows only, to build use ScintillaGL.sln with MSVC2010.



Demo keys
===================================

General
---------------------------------------------
F5 - show/hide shader editor layout
F7 - compile current shader and link current program
Alt-N, where N=1..3 - select shader/program list, shader editor, shader output respectively
Esc - exit program

Shader/program list specific:
---------------------------------------------
Enter - select program/shader, when shader is selected its source is loaded into shader editor
Backspace - return to programs when shaders list is displayed



Embedding
===================================

For embeding you only require *.h files from scintilla directory and scintilla.lib, scintilla_d.lib.



License
===================================

It's complicated, but all my code should be under zlib license. All original code, even if it is modified by me, I think is still under scintilla license, so not sure.
Scintilla is licensed under some very permissive license.
